This is the fourth LHS sample program.
This program illustrates how you can play back a file.
It also shows some integrated TTS. 

For example:

Select a text and play it back.
Then edit the text and save your changes.
Have the program read your text once again.

As you will see, you don't need to quit your program 
for the changes to take effect.

Good luck.
