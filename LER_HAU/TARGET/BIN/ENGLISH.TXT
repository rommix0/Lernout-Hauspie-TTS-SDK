    Hello!
    Welcome to Lernout & Hauspie's TTS Evaluator.  This Evaluator is a
    windows program, based on Lernout & Hauspie's TTS system, which
    is designed to read any text.  A clear human voice reads the text
    directly from your keyboard or from file.  The TTS conversion is
    based on state of the art technology from Lernout & Hauspie.

    The speech output can be controlled in terms of volume, pitch and
    speech rate.
    *V9 The volume can either be loud, *V2 or it can be very soft.
    *F It's *"up to *"you.
    *I9 The pitch can be very high. *I1 And it can be low too.
    *F Depending on your preference.
    *R1 The speech rate can be very slow. *R9 Or very fast.
    *F Whatever the user *"prefers.

    Apart from changing volume, pitch and rate, the TTS Evaluator shows a high
    flexibility in choosing different speakers and generating tones.
    *S9 This is speaker 9. *S5 This is speaker 5. *S2 And speaker 2.
    *F Depending on the voice characteristics needed.
    Also, generating beep tones is no problem:
    *w1*b0*b1*b2*b3*b4*b5*b6*b7*b8*b9.     *f
    Even DTMF tones are supported: *w1*t1*t3*t5*t7*t9.
    *f If requested, the system can spell the text.
    *m0 *w1 Evaluator, *f Evaluator.
    The user can also manipulate the accent structure.
    John is coming *"tomorrow. *"John is coming tomorrow.
    *f The system can split the text up into textlines or sentences.
    Special intonation rules are used to create natural sounding speech output.
    Abbreviations, dates, currencies: they are no problem for the TTS Evaluator.
    *m3 e.g.: 05/03/93, $1,500 or 100 DM
